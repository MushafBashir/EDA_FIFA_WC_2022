For the first time in FIFA World Cup history, the tournament was hosted by a Middle Eastern country, Qatar. All 64 matches were played across 8 venues in 5 cities. This tournament was marked by several notable events and surprises. For the first time, a Middle Eastern team, Morocco, reached the semi-finals. Additionally, Saudi Arabia defeated Argentina, which had won the World Cup twice before, and ultimately won the tournament. There are many aspects of this tournament that we will explore and analyze in the Exploratory Data Analysis."

### In this Exploratory Data Analysis, we will find the following from Group Data:

- **Team with Most Wins:** Identify the team that won the most matches.  
- **Team with Most Goals Scored:** Find out which team scored the highest number of goals.  
- **Team with No Wins:** Determine which team failed to win a single match.  
- **Team with Most Goals Conceded:** Identify which team allowed the most goals against them.  
- **Team with Highest Goal Difference:** Calculate which team has the highest goal difference (goals scored minus goals conceded).  
- **Highest Points in Group Stage:** Find out which team accumulated the most points in the group stage.  
- **Teams Qualifying for Round of 16:** Determine which teams advanced to the Round of 16 based on their group performance.
